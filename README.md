# Digital-Stop-Watch

Verilog Code for a project implemented in a FPGA Cyclone IV. The project consists of a stopwatch that counts from 00:00 to 59:99 seconds and have two buttons, one to start/stop the stopwatch and one to reset the counter. It displays in a BCD-Seven-Segments Display.

Uses 26 D-Flip Flops to decrease the internal 50MHz clock of the FPGA.
